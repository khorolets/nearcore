# NEAR Indexer

NEAR Indexer is a micro-framework, which provides you with a stream of blocks that are recorded on NEAR network.


NEAR Indexer is useful to handle real-time "events" on the chain.


NEAR Indexer is going to be used to build NEAR Explorer, augment NEAR Wallet, and provide overview of events in Rainbow Bridge.


See the [example](https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore/tree/master/tools/indexer/example) for further details.
